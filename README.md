# WebDebloater
WebDebloater is an experimental filter for blocking extensions such as uBlock Origin. It aims to block where other lists do not, annoying recommendations on sites that don't need them, sharing buttons, and other general annoyances.
It aims to durastically reduce the amount of bandwidth and resources used on websites.
# What does the dynamic filter do?
In uBlock Origin, there is a feature called dynamic filtering. You can block javascript or certain sites from loading on other pages. For example, if you're on foo.com, uBlock Origin has the ability to block bar.com from loading any scripts or images.
This feature is mainly for testing purposes and should not be used by users unless you know what you're doing.
